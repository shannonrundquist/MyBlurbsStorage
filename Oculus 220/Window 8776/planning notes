1. Is the ice significantly enough different in structure or composition, 
even though is water, that unique and interesting ice sculptures could 
be made and be different from ice scupltures elsewhere (of exact same 
design)?  Could these be of extra value to offworlders versus the same
sculptures from elsewhere?  Certainly would be large as would need 
refrigeration unit to be included in transfer and sale.

2. check out "organic material" from Low Pass Scan result.  Is also the
basis of above sculpture idea as maybe the material will create unique
sculptures.
