Note this was done from orbit based off of Low Pass Scan results.

Investigation/Window/Ice/Subsurface Scan
    The sector is composed not only of ice but also a considerable amount of
    organic material and sediment. The two contaminants are not necessarily
    found in the same locations but more often than not they do appear to be
    linked.
    The team suspect that cryo-volcanic activity may be responsible, releasing
    large amount of hydrocarbon compounds but also more mundane inert compounds
    from within the mantle.
    Exploitation of the hydrocarbons will be quite straightforward.
