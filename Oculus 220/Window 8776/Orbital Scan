Orbital Scan/Window
    The ice world on the edge of the system receives very little light at the
    moment, though its two hundred year orbit brings it significantly closer to
    the primary than its current position. The team suspect that during this
    perihelion the surface and atmospheric temperature increase significantly
    though is unlikely to be sufficient to melt its icy exterior.
    Orbital scans reveal the presence of many small satellites. These natural
    lumps of rock tend to be quite bright on account of a surface coating of
    bright ice.
