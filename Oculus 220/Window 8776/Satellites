Investigation/Window/Satellites
    These natural moonlets have a thick white coating of icy material though
    under this they are fairly solid rock.
    The ice is likely extra-planetary in origin although it would be impossible
    to accurately pinpoint at which point in the satellites history that the
    ice accumulated. It is most probable that the satellites had developed most
    of the ice layer before being captured by Window. Analysis of the ice finds
    nothing of exploitable value.
    They can be used to augment platforms.
    A one-off special action by a platform in orbit will add 850 asteroid
    platform hulls to the platform.
